# 🐍 Python Daily Learning Logs  

This repository is a collection of my **daily Python learning journey**, including code snippets, practice exercises, and notes.  
The goal is to document my progress, reinforce concepts, and build a consistent learning habit.

Each day’s learning is organized into a log file or folder with code examples and explanations.  
- **Day 1:** Python basics – variables, data types, input/output  
- **Day 2:** Control flow – if/else, loops, and basic problem solving  
- **Day 3:** Functions, arguments, return values  
- *(and so on...)*
